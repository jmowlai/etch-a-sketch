The purpose of this project is to create a browser version of a sketchpad / Etch-A-Sketch

We will have to utilise methods learned prior in the TOP course such as CSS and JS.

First we will need to create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

Then set-up a hover effect so grids change colour when the mouse passes over them, creating a trail through the grid emulating a pen on paper.
